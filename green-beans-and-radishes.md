# Green beans & radishes

## Ingredients

* Green beans (~75%)
* Radishes (~25%)
* Two cloves of garlic

## Prep

* Slice the ends off the beans
* Cut tops and roots from radishes and slice in half
* Peel garlic cloves

## Ferment

* Lacto fermentation
* Put ingredients in jar, add enough brine to cover all vegetables. Approximately 3% salinity.
* Add a weight to keep ingredients below the surface, I filled a sandwich bag with water and put it in my jar.
* Ferment until ready. For me that was 10 days in spring in the south of the UK. The pigment will come out of the skin of 
  the radishes and turn the brine bright pink, then get absorbed back into them so they are pink-ish right the way through.
  The beans should remain pretty crunchy.
  
## Use
* Both the radish and the beans are pretty good by themselves. Easy to snack on, and a good salty snack to go with beer.
* I also chopped up some of these finely and mixed them with BBQ sauce as a burger relish.
