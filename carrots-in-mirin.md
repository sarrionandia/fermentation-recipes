# Carrots in mirin

## Ingredients
* Carrots
* 3 or 4 Thai chili peppers
* 4 Cloves of garlic
* Mirin

## Prep
* Peel and slice carrots
* Peel garlic

## Ferment
* Lacto fermentation
* Put ingredients in a jar, cover in 2-3% salinity brine
* Use weight to keep ingredients under the water
* Wait until done. I think there's a pretty huge range of levels of fermentation possible with carrots, they seem 
  to tolerate a lot. For me, I left them 12 days in the south of the UK in spring. Pay attention to the garlic taste, it 
  gets really strong quite fast.
* Pour out ~10% of the brine and replace with mirin. Obviously this means the brine probably isn't great to kick start your 
  next ferment if you like doing that.
  
## Use
* These taste pretty weird, sweet and salty and sour at the same time. 
* They're pretty good by themselves, but also good in a stir fry in small doses.
